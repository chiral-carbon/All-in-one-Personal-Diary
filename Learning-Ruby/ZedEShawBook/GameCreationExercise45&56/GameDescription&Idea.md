# LIFE

## GAME DESCRIPTION
It is a sadistic boring game, sadly that is all I could come up with right now, if you need motivation to win your life over, you could maybe try it out. :P
Game starts with the player(student) being in a school, challenge is to score good marks and crack IIT-JEE exam cutoff to get into college.
In college, student has to show off skills in placement session to get a job.
If the student gets a job, game over and won.
If job not secured, or IIT-JEE cutoff not cleared, game over, student dies.
